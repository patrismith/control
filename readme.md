Submission for the GBJAM 2 @ gbjam.net

All original music, art, most of the framework, etc... the only thing is, we didn't have time to make the 
'gameplay' part. Oops! 

You can run the game by installing LOVE2D on your system and downloading the LOVE file above! It also runs great in the Chrome/Chromium browser with the Loveliness plugin!

I haven't tested other methods! Good Luck!
